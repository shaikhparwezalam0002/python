# You need to perform three separate tasks based on the given input:

# String Input and Print: Take a text input as a string and print it as it is.
# Integer Input and Add: Take an integer input n, add 10 to it, and print the result.
# Float Input and Multiply: Take a floating-point number as input, multiply it by 10, and print the result.

# Input: s = "Hello", n = 20, f = 5.5
# Output: 
# Hello
# 30
# 55.0
# Explanation: 
# The string Hello is printed as it is.
# The integer 20 is increased by 10 and results in 30.
# The floating-point number 5.5 is multiplied by 10 and results in 55.0.
